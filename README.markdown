# iTunes Plug-in Notes #

## Scripting Bridge ##

The Scripting Bridge code requires `iTunes.h`. To make the most recent iTunes features available, a fresh copy of this file should be created whenever a new version of iTunes is released. The file can be created by running:

    sdef /Applications/iTunes.app | sdp -fh --basename iTunes

You should [familiarize yourself with Scripting Bridge][sbdoc] a bit before making any changes to this plug-in. Particularly the sections that discuss performance.

In the end though, you just need to test everything out and see what works. Here are some tips specific to iTunes:

  1. When you want to look through "all tracks", use the Music playlist, not the Library playlist.
  
     ```objective-c
     iTunesApplication *iTunes = [SBApplication applicationWithBundleIdentifier:@"com.apple.iTunes"];
     iTunesSource *library = [[[[iTunes sources] get] filteredArrayUsingPredicate:[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"kind == %i", iTunesESrcLibrary]] objectAtIndex:0];
     iTunesLibraryPlaylist *lp = [[[[library playlists] get] filteredArrayUsingPredicate:[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"specialKind == %i", iTunesESpKMusic]] objectAtIndex:0];
     ```
  
     Using the Library playlist can make certain things take thousands of times longer. (That's not an exaggeration.) Specifically, filtering out tracks with predicates involving `kind`, `videoKind`, or `albumArtist` is unusably slow (though it will eventually work). 
  
  2. When filtering the Music playlist for certain criteria, always call `get` on the resulting array. This can be tricky, since `filteredArrayUsingPredicate:` returns an NSArray which doesn't have a `get`, but it can be made to work by casting it as an SBElementArray.
  

     ```objective-c
     NSArray *tracks = [(SBElementArray *)[[musicPlaylist tracks] filteredArrayUsingPredicate:trackFilter] get];
     ```
 
     Depending on what you search for, everything you do with the result can be very slow. By calling `get` on it right away and using the result of that for everything else, you're essentially limiting the slowness to a single call.
  
  3. Always use `tracks` instead of `fileTracks`. `fileTracks` can slow things down even if you use the `get` trick above. Using `tracks` is quick.

## The iTunes Library and Quicksilver's Catalog ##

Most plug-ins put things directly into Quicksilver's catalog. iTunes typically holds a large number of items and it's unlikely that someone will want them all in the catalog. (Do you need every individual song at your fingertips?)

You may have noticed that browsing through artists, albums, playlists, etc. is very fast in Quicksilver even though most of these things aren't in the catalog. The reason is that the plug-in reads in the entire iTunes library from `~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music Library.xml` into memory using `dictionaryWithContentsOfFile:`. The `QSObject`s you see when browsing around are generated on-the-fly from what's in the dictionary.

About Quicksilver Plugins on Github
===================================

This repository contains the current source code of a the Quicksilver Plugin / Module. If you're having issues with this plugin, feel free to log them at the [Quicksilver issue tracker](https://github.com/quicksilver/Quicksilver/issues).

Always be sure to check the [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/blacktree-quicksilver/topics?gvc=2) first incase there's a solution to your problem, as well as the [QSApp.com Wiki](http://qsapp.com/wiki/).


Before You Try It Out
---------------------

Before trying out any of these plugins, it's always a good idea to **BACKUP** all of your Quicksilver data.

This is easily done by backing up the following folders 

(`<user>` stands for your short user name):

`/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver`  
`/Users/<user>/Library/Caches/Quicksilver`

	
Before Building
---------------

Before being able to build any of these plugins, you **MUST** set a new Source Tree for the `QSFramework` in the XCode Preferences.

This is done by going into the XCode preferences, clicking 'Source Trees' and adding a new one with the following options:

Setting Name: `QSFrameworks`  
Display Name: a suitable name, e.g. `Quicksilver Frameworks`  
Path: `/Applications/Quicksilver.app/Contents/Frameworks` (or path of Quicksilver.app if different)

For some plugins to compile correctly a source tree must also be set for `QS_SOURCE_ROOT` that points to the location of the [Quicksilver source code](https://github.com/quicksilver/Quicksilver) you've downloaded onto your local machine.

Setting Name: `QS_SOURCE_ROOT`	
Display Name: a suitable name, e.g. `Quicksilver source code root`	 
Path: `/Users/<user>/<path to Quicksilver source code>`

See the QSApp.com wiki for more information on [Building Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com/wiki/Building_Quicksilver).

Also check out the [Quicksilver Plugins Development Reference](http://projects.skurfer.com/QuicksilverPlug-inReference.mdown), especially the [Building and Testing section](http://projects.skurfer.com/QuicksilverPlug-inReference.mdown#building_and_testing).
